			<h1><small>About Me</small></h1>
			<h4>I have been a lot of things in my life. From a stint touring with a Bluegrass group playing the guitar, 
			banjo, and upright bass, to a sailor, landlocked on a P3 base in the San Francisco Bay area of California.I have
			been a woodturner, electrician, maintenance man and a machinist which is my current full time occupation. But I have 			 always been a learner, and as such, when the world changed and the internet started taking place of normal buisness 			 interaction I was naturally attracted to mystery and fun of coding.</h4>
